at least one withering deku baba should not be randomized
skullwallutas are included but not gold skullwallutassfm wolf not included in randomizedthe baris that drop from the ceiling in room3 of jabu aren't randomizedI believe the stalfos in the forest are not being randomizedkd
I only saw one buble in the basement of the well
bats in the well aren't randomized (the ones that spawn from the graveyard)
adult kokiri and adult sfm are not randomizedpoes in graveyard aren't randomized

baby dodongos won't spawn where hanging skullutas are

Find out if any rooms in vanilla oot where the same actor is there twice with different variables
   If so, and if one of the variables is not one that's randomized, I believe the one not getting randomized won't spawn

move names of columns/tables into global constants to make easy to change

exclude rooms option, switch vars option, make sure fromvars works
refactor so it makes sense
need some functions for debug cheats (give items/adult or kid link etc)

for a future refactor (lol), I think the right proper way to do it is thins
a dictionary of the available enemies for randomization
when you setup the rooms, go through and mark each actor as a randomizable enemy or not (and mark the type), then you can loop through those a lot more simply with less complicated checks
   also good for doing advanced memory management/such things
