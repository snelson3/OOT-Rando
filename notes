TODO
  Randomizer features that will be in my pull request:
    Triforce transitions
    maybe the beta pedestal swap
    enemy randomizer
      1-1 species swap
      or 
      swap each object/actor in each map independently
         make sure to have logic so enemies can still be killed
      Arwing makes an appearence somewhere


BUGS
There's definitely a bug because I checked spot04_room_0 and it has En_Kusa but the replacement_log doesn't list it changing

Things to Test
  I want to mess with replacing the rolling boulder for fun, what happens if it spawns in weird places?
  This isn't supposed to work for dynamic enemies, so figure if the following works
    Stalchilds at night - They are spawned with En_Enount1 Actor, so that would need to be hacked
    Wolfos at start of SFM - works but switch flag needs to be correct
    Deku guarding way to slingshot room
    Water enemies in non water? - Don't seem to spawn

Eventually want to mess with bosses, pretty sure that super fucks things up


TODO LIST 
  Do a test playthrough where all enemies are turned into bubbles, to find rooms that don't work right
  Add the triforce transitions mod to keysanity, and do a pull request for that 
  Test the things in the notes with the spreadsheet (mostly room clear testing)
  rewrite the randomizer cells so they share more code (the framework of searching each room)
  add in ways to exclude certain rooms/enemies from the randomizer
  add in the way to make switch rooms work.
  get it working in the TR fork 
  write up a detailed pull request with what is getting randomized
  see what happens?
